# Goal Definition Examples

## Example 1: Bug Hunt Article

**Topic:** Debugging a memory leak in a Python web service

**Goal Statement:**
"The goal of this article is to help Python developers identify and fix memory leaks in long-running web services using practical debugging techniques."

**Differentiator Statement:**
"My perspective is interesting because I spent 3 weeks tracking down a subtle memory leak that only appeared under production load, and I documented every wrong turn along the way."

**Target Reader:** Python developers running Flask/Django apps in production

**Prior Knowledge:** Understands Python basics, has deployed web services, knows what memory leaks are conceptually

**Why They Care:** Their service might be slowly consuming memory and they don't know why

**Desired Outcome:** Know how to use memory profiling tools and recognize common leak patterns

## Example 2: Rewrote It in X Article

**Topic:** Migrating a data pipeline from Python to Rust

**Goal Statement:**
"The goal of this article is to help data engineers evaluate whether rewriting their Python data pipelines in Rust is worth the effort and understand what the migration actually involves."

**Differentiator Statement:**
"My perspective is interesting because I migrated a 50K lines Python pipeline to Rust, reduced costs by 70%, but also encountered pitfalls that almost made us abandon the project."

**Target Reader:** Data engineers considering Rust, familiar with Python

**Prior Knowledge:** Experienced with Python data processing, heard of Rust but not expert

**Why They Care:** Cloud costs are high, Python performance is a bottleneck

**Desired Outcome:** Can make informed decision about whether Rust migration makes sense for their situation

## Example 3: How We Built It Article

**Topic:** Building a real-time collaboration feature

**Goal Statement:**
"The goal of this article is to share the architectural decisions behind our real-time collaboration feature so other teams can learn from our approach and tradeoffs."

**Differentiator Statement:**
"My perspective is interesting because we built this to handle 100K concurrent editors with sub-100ms sync, and I can share what worked and what we'd do differently."

**Target Reader:** Engineers building collaborative features, architects evaluating technologies

**Prior Knowledge:** Understands distributed systems basics, familiar with WebSockets

**Why They Care:** Building similar features, want to learn from others' experiences

**Desired Outcome:** Understand architectural options for real-time collaboration and their tradeoffs

## Example 4: Lessons Learned Article

**Topic:** Leading a team through a major refactoring

**Goal Statement:**
"The goal of this article is to share practical lessons about managing large refactoring projects so technical leads can avoid the mistakes we made."

**Differentiator Statement:**
"My perspective is interesting because our 6-month refactoring took 14 months and I've reflected deeply on what went wrong and what we'd do differently."

**Target Reader:** Tech leads, engineering managers planning large refactors

**Prior Knowledge:** Has led technical projects, understands refactoring concepts

**Why They Care:** Planning a similar project, worried about scope creep and timeline

**Desired Outcome:** Concrete strategies for scoping, communicating, and executing large refactors

## Example 5: Thoughts on Trends Article

**Topic:** The future of serverless databases

**Goal Statement:**
"The goal of this article is to argue that serverless databases will become the default choice within 5 years and explain what developers should do to prepare."

**Differentiator Statement:**
"My perspective is interesting because I've been building database infrastructure for 15 years and have watched three paradigm shifts - I see the same patterns emerging now."

**Target Reader:** Developers and architects making database decisions

**Prior Knowledge:** Understands traditional databases, aware of serverless concept

**Why They Care:** Making technology decisions with 5+ year implications

**Desired Outcome:** Understand the trend and how to position their skills/architecture
