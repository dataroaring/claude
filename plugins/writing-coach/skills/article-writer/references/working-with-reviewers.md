# Working with Reviewers

## Why Review Matters

Writing review is similar to code review in many ways. Just as another pair of eyes can catch bugs you've become blind to, a reviewer can spot issues in your writing that you've become too familiar with to notice.

## Selecting Your Reviewers

### The Ideal Combination

**Technical Reviewer:**
- Knows the subject matter deeply
- Can verify technical accuracy
- Catches factual errors
- Identifies missing context that experts would want

**Clarity Reviewer:**
- Someone unfamiliar with the topic
- Catches assumptions you're making
- Identifies jargon that needs explanation
- Represents your actual target reader

### Choosing Good Reviewers

**Do they have time and willingness?**
- A rushed review helps no one
- Better to have one thorough reviewer than three distracted ones

**Will they give honest feedback?**
- "Looks good!" is not helpful
- You need someone who will push back

**Do they represent your target audience?**
- Match reviewer expertise to reader expertise
- If writing for beginners, have a beginner review

## When to Start Review

### Ask Yourself These Questions

**1. How important and/or controversial is the topic?**
- Higher stakes = more review cycles needed
- Controversial topics need extra scrutiny
- Company announcements need broader review

**2. Do you have a true "blocker" question?**
- Something you can't proceed without answering
- A decision that affects the entire article direction
- Technical uncertainty that needs expert input

**3. Have you done what you intended to do?**
- Check against your goal statement
- Did you cover what you planned to cover?
- Is anything missing from your outline?

**4. Will there be time for another cycle after review?**
- Don't send for review the night before deadline
- Account for reviewer response time
- Plan for revision after feedback

### Don't Review Too Early

**Signs you're not ready:**
- Major sections still missing
- Core argument not yet formed
- You're still discovering what you want to say

### Don't Review Too Late

**Signs you waited too long:**
- No time to incorporate feedback
- You're emotionally attached to every word
- Deadline pressure prevents thoughtful revision

## Preparing Your Reviewers

### Provide Background

Before asking for review, share:

**What's the goal of this article?**
- "The goal is to convince database users to try our migration tool"
- "I want to explain why we chose this architecture"

**Who's the target reader?**
- "Developers familiar with PostgreSQL but not our product"
- "Anyone on Hacker News interested in performance"

**What stage is the draft in?**
- "This is a rough draft—ignore typos"
- "Near final—focus on polish"
- "Structure is set—looking for technical accuracy"

### Specify What You Want

Be explicit about what feedback you need:

**Technical focus:**
- "Please verify the technical claims are accurate"
- "Is my explanation of X correct?"
- "Am I missing any important caveats?"

**Clarity focus:**
- "Is this easy to follow for someone new to the topic?"
- "Where did you get confused?"
- "What questions did you have that weren't answered?"

**Specific sections:**
- "I'm uncertain about section 3—does it make sense?"
- "The conclusion feels weak—suggestions?"
- "Is the introduction engaging enough?"

**What's NOT ready for review:**
- "Ignore the code examples—they're placeholders"
- "The ending isn't written yet"
- "I know the formatting is messy"

## Responding to Reviewer Comments

### Do

**Thank reviewers for their time:**
- Review is work; acknowledge it
- Even if you disagree, appreciate the effort

**Address every comment:**
- "Noted—will fix"
- "Keeping as-is because [reason]"
- "Good catch—revised"
- Don't leave comments hanging

**Ask clarifying questions:**
- "Can you elaborate on what felt unclear?"
- "What would you suggest instead?"
- "Is this better?" (after revision)

**Consider the feedback thoughtfully:**
- Sleep on it before rejecting
- Look for patterns in feedback
- Multiple people saying the same thing = real issue

### Don't

**Argue with every suggestion:**
- You asked for feedback; receive it graciously
- Not every suggestion needs a rebuttal
- Save energy for important disagreements

**Ignore feedback you don't like:**
- If you're defensive, examine why
- The feedback might be right
- At minimum, acknowledge you heard it

**Make reviewers feel their time was wasted:**
- Don't send unchanged drafts back
- Show you incorporated feedback
- Close the loop on what you changed

## Special Cases

### Non-Native English Speakers

**Get at least one native speaker review:**
- Idioms and phrasing that sound "off"
- Tone and register issues
- Grammar rules that differ between languages

**Focus areas:**
- Article usage (a/an/the)
- Preposition choices
- Sentence structure and flow
- Colloquial expressions

### Don't Know Who to Ask?

**Writing communities and forums:**
- Technical writing groups
- Developer communities
- Industry Slack channels

**Colleagues in adjacent teams:**
- Someone familiar but not expert = good clarity reviewer
- Exchange reviews with other writers

**Professional editors:**
- For high-stakes posts
- Company blog editors
- Freelance technical editors

### Sensitive Topics

**Get additional review for:**
- Security disclosures
- Company announcements
- Criticism of others' work
- Legal or compliance topics

**Include in review:**
- Legal/compliance teams when needed
- PR/communications for company voice
- Subject matter experts who might be affected
