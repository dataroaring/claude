# Writing Styles That Sound Human (Not AI)

Based on "Writing for Developers" by Piotr Sarna & Cynthia Dunlop

## What Makes Writing Sound Human

### 1. Be Authentic and Relatable

From the book's "Keeping it human" section:

- **Share your background** when relevant to the discussion
- **Reveal what was going through your head** during triumphs and tribulations
- **Admit worries, frustrations, mistakes, and imperfections**
- **Be open about what you don't (yet) know**
- **Poke fun at yourself**

> "These are the things that will keep your reader engaged and also clearly distinguish you from a machine."

### 2. Write in Your Own Voice

Your writing should sound like chatting with colleagues over lunch:

| Element | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| **Word choice** | Use words you'd normally use. Don't raid the thesaurus. |
| **Sentence length** | Match how you naturally speak |
| **Tone** | If you're enthusiastic, sarcastic, witty, reserved - let it show |
| **Formality** | Contractions and colloquialisms are fine if that's how you speak |

**Test:** If a close friend read your article, would they recognize your personality?

### 3. Connect Emotionally

- **Emotion equals engagement**
- Share authentic elements: curiosity, frustration, excitement, the "aha moment"
- Don't force it - forced attempts to evoke emotion will be detected and ridiculed
- **Just be real**

### 4. Address the Reader Directly

- Use "I" or "we" for yourself
- Use "you" for the reader
- Avoid impersonal terms like "people," "users," "one might"
- Engage the reader: "What would you have done here?"

## AI-Generated Writing Red Flags

These markers indicate AI-generated text:

| Red Flag | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Unusually dense metaphors** | Maintaining extremely high density of themed references throughout |
| **Overly flowery language** | Consistently ornate/poetic prose that feels artificial |
| **Lack of specific technical details** | No concrete examples, code snippets, or real experience |
| **Perfect thematic consistency** | Theme maintained flawlessly without drift (humans naturally drift) |
| **Artificial emotional arc** | Hitting predictable notes of curiosity → challenge → triumph |
| **Too-perfect structure** | Follows idealized template rather than natural recounting |
| **Lack of genuine personal anecdotes** | No specific, idiosyncratic details from real experience |
| **Overuse of cultural references** | Feels generated from a list rather than organically incorporated |

## How to Sound More Human

### DO:

- Include **specific, idiosyncratic details** from your real experience
- Let your writing have **natural variation in tone**
- Include **concrete technical details** (code, numbers, commands)
- Share **genuine personal anecdotes** with messy, real-world details
- Allow **natural drift** in theme and style
- Incorporate personal references **organically**, not systematically

### DON'T:

- Maintain artificially consistent metaphors throughout
- Use perfectly structured emotional arcs
- Write prose that's consistently ornate
- Hit predictable narrative beats (curiosity → challenge → triumph)
- Over-explain or over-polish every sentence
- Remove all the "messy" human elements

## The Ultimate Test

Ask yourself:

1. **Does this sound like me talking to a colleague over lunch?**
2. **Would a close friend recognize my personality in this writing?**
3. **Did I include real, specific details from my actual experience?**
4. **Did I share what I was thinking/feeling at key moments?**
5. **Did I admit my mistakes, uncertainties, and frustrations?**

## Human-Voice Checklist

Use this when reviewing for authentic voice:

- [ ] Includes at least one moment of admitted uncertainty or mistake
- [ ] Has specific technical details (not just generalities)
- [ ] Contains a genuine personal anecdote with specific details
- [ ] Voice varies naturally (not perfectly consistent)
- [ ] Emotional moments feel earned, not manufactured
- [ ] Would pass the "friend recognition" test
- [ ] Contains at least one self-deprecating comment or admitted frustration

## Examples of Human vs AI Voice

### AI-sounding (avoid):

> "Zig was like a breath of fresh air in a smog-choked C++ cave. Gone were the cryptic templates and memory management migraines. Zig's static typing held my hand like a friendly sherpa, guiding me through the treacherous landscape of data conversion."

**Problems:** Overly dense metaphors, consistently flowery, no specific technical details, artificial emotional arc.

### Human-sounding (aim for):

> "Zig is not Rust, and it happily lets you dereference null pointers and use previously freed memory. This led to long debugging sessions—just us, gdb, and the ninth cup of coffee—but it was comforting to see all the existing tools just work."

**Why it works:** Specific technical detail (gdb), admitted frustration (long debugging), self-deprecating humor (ninth cup of coffee), natural voice.

## Specific Techniques

### Share the Messy Reality

Instead of: "We solved the problem"
Write: "After three false starts and one embarrassing typo that cost us two hours, we finally figured out the issue"

### Include Specific Details

Instead of: "The performance improved significantly"
Write: "Latency dropped from 200ms to 15ms—I actually refreshed the dashboard three times because I didn't believe it"

### Admit What You Don't Know

Instead of: "This approach is optimal"
Write: "I'm still not 100% sure this is the best approach, but it's working well so far"

### Show Your Thinking Process

Instead of: "We chose Redis"
Write: "We debated between Redis and Memcached for about a week. Redis won mostly because half the team already knew it—pragmatism over perfection"

### Include Emotional Beats

Instead of: "The bug was difficult to find"
Write: "I spent two days convinced the bug was in our code. Turns out it was a known issue in the library we were using. I'm not proud of the words I said when I found that GitHub issue."
