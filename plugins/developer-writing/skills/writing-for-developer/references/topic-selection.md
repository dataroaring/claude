# Topic Selection

Based on "Writing for Developers" by Piotr Sarna & Cynthia Dunlop

## The Most Important Decision

Selecting a promising topic is the **single most important task** for creating an engineering blog post that gets read. A catchy title, eloquent sentences, solid code examples—none of that matters if you're not covering a topic that's a good fit for both you and your readers.

The flip side: if you provide an impressive level of technical insight on a topic your readers truly care about, slight imperfections (like a few rough sentences) will likely be forgiven.

## The 3 Ps Test

To set yourself up for success, use this test when evaluating potential blog post topics. Does your topic meet at least one of the 3 Ps?

### Proud Of

What accomplishments are you eager to show off to your engineering peers?

**Examples:**
- Impressive feature implementation
- Architectural breakthrough
- Performance improvement
- Open source contribution
- Successful migration

**Question:** What's really going to impress your users or fellow contributors?

### Pained By

What challenges have been causing constant headaches and blocking forward progress?

**Examples:**
- Debugging nightmare that took days
- Migration that went wrong
- Scaling crisis
- Production incident
- Technical debt that bit back

**Question:** What problems kept you up at night?

### Passionate About

What else gets your blood racing?

**Examples:**
- Strong opinion on a technology
- Industry trend you love or hate
- Tool comparison you feel strongly about
- Best practices you wish everyone followed
- Controversial take backed by experience

**Question:** What would you rant about to colleagues over lunch?

- Any tangible result that can be described

**Security incident post-mortem:**
- Why did the incident happen?
- How did you discover it?
- How did you fix it?
- How did you ensure it wouldn't happen again?
- Can it affect other projects?

**Infrastructure survival stories:**
- How you handled a traffic spike
- What went wrong and how you recovered
- Black Friday drama (or lack thereof)
- Capacity planning lessons

**Bug hunting:**
- Mysterious bugs that took days to find
- The "aha moment" of discovery

**Controversial opinions (backed by experience):**
- Technologies that don't deserve their reputation
- Best practices that aren't always best
- Tools that are overhyped or underrated

**Predictions and analysis:**
- Where technology is heading
- Past predictions revisited
- Trend analysis with your unique take

**Book/tool reviews:**
- What you learned
- How you applied it
- Honest assessment

### For Your Users

**Clarifications:**
- Features that confuse users
- Common questions you keep answering
- Documentation gaps

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

## Testing Your Topic Idea

### The Social Media Test

Want a virtually effortless way to test response to a topic idea? Float it out as a social post.

- **If it takes off:** Good indicator that a related blog post could gain traction
- **If it doesn't strike a chord:** Try a few more variations before giving up (social media is fickle)

### The "Would I Read This?" Test

Ask yourself:
- Would I click on this title if I saw it on Hacker News?
- Would I share this if someone else wrote it?
- Does this offer genuine value or insight?

### The Uniqueness Test

Consider:
- Can readers get this information elsewhere easily?
- Do I have unique experience or insight on this?
- Am I the right person to write this?

## Topic Ideas Checklist

Before committing to a topic:

- [ ] Passes at least one of the 3 Ps (Proud, Pained, Passionate)
- [ ] You have unique insight or experience
- [ ] Target readers would genuinely care
- [ ] You can provide specific details, not just generalities
- [ ] It hasn't been covered better by someone more qualified
- [ ] You have (or can gather) the technical details needed
- [ ] It's timely or evergreen enough to be worth writing

## When to Abandon a Topic

Sometimes you'll hit a wall. It's fine to set aside a topic that isn't clicking.

**Signs to abandon:**
- You can't pass the 3 Ps test no matter how you frame it
- You don't have enough unique insight
- Someone else has already covered it thoroughly
- You can't make it actionable or valuable

**Remember:** You can always revisit later if you have an epiphany. Even if you never publish, chalk it up as a learning experience.
