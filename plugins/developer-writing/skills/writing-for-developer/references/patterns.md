# Blog Post Patterns - Detailed Guide

## 1. Bug Hunt Pattern

**Purpose:** Tell a detective story about finding and fixing an elusive bug

**Audience:**
- Engineers working with similar technologies who might face the same bug
- Those who want to learn debugging techniques and tools
- General tech readers who enjoy a good mystery story

**Key Characteristics:**
- Structured like a mystery/detective story with rising tension
- Shows the debugging journey step-by-step
- Technical details are "spoilers" - readers follow along trying to solve it
- Authentic frustration and "aha moments" make it relatable
- The bug itself should be interesting (rare, subtle, or affecting popular tech)

**Structure:**
1. The symptoms - what went wrong
2. Initial hypotheses - what you thought caused it
3. Investigation - the debugging journey with false leads
4. The breakthrough - the "aha moment"
5. The fix - what you changed and why it works
6. Lessons learned - what readers can take away

**Dos:**
- Start with symptoms, not solutions
- Show false leads and dead ends (they teach readers)
- Include specific technical details (error messages, stack traces, code snippets)
- Explain your debugging methodology and tools
- Share the emotional journey (frustration, breakthrough)
- Provide the fix and explain WHY it works

**Don'ts:**
- Don't reveal the solution upfront (kills the narrative)
- Don't skip the "boring" investigation steps
- Don't make yourself look perfect - show mistakes
- Don't choose a bug that's trivial or unrelatable

**Structure:**
1. Context - what existed before and why consider rewriting
2. Decision - why you chose the new technology
3. The journey - how the rewrite progressed

6. Results - what you gained (and lost)
7. Recommendations - who should (and shouldn't) consider this

**Dos:**
- Explain your starting point and motivations clearly

**Key Characteristics:**
- More formal, technical, and educational tone
- Focuses on architecture, design decisions, and tradeoffs
- Includes diagrams, code examples, and system designs
- Explains WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was built
- Often written by teams, not individuals

**Structure:**
1. Problem/challenge being solved
2. High-level architecture overview
3. Key technical decisions (with rationale)
4. Implementation details of interesting components
5. Tradeoffs considered and made
6. Results and performance
7. Future improvements and limitations

**Dos:**
- Start with the problem/challenge you were solving
- Include architecture diagrams and visual aids
- Explain key technical decisions and their rationale
- Share the tradeoffs considered
- Provide enough detail for someone to understand the approach
- Acknowledge limitations and future improvements

**Don'ts:**
- Don't turn it into marketing - stay educational
- Don't skip over interesting technical challenges
- Don't assume readers know your domain - provide context

## 4. Lessons Learned Pattern

**Purpose:** Share wisdom gained from real-world experience and challenges

**Audience:**
- Engineers who might face similar situations
- Those looking for practical advice
- Technical leaders making similar decisions
- Anyone who appreciates battle-tested insights

**Key Characteristics:**

- Focuses on actionable takeaways
- Often structured as a list of lessons
- Authentic voice sharing real struggles

**Structure:**
1. Context - the situation that led to these lessons
2. Lesson 1 - with specific experience backing it
3. Lesson 2 - with specific experience backing it
4. ... (continue for each lesson)
5. Summary - key takeaways

**Dos:**
- Ground each lesson in specific experience
- Be honest about what went wrong
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Share context so readers can assess applicability
- Include both technical and non-technical lessons
- Admit uncertainty where it exists

**Don'ts:**

## 5. Thoughts on Trends Pattern

**Purpose:** Share an opinionated take on industry trends

**Audience:**
- The broader tech community following trends
- Engineers making technology decisions
- Those who value expert opinions
- "Hacker News crowd" interested in industry discourse

**Key Characteristics:**
- Highly opinionated - your opinion IS the core value
- Requires established credibility or expertise
- Uses persuasion techniques: Ethos (credibility), Pathos (emotion), Logos (logic)
- Takes a clear position on controversial topics
